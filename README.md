#README#

my-personal-website is a web project I am working on.

Webpage containing information related to me. This is a work in progress, as is my programming career.

Basically this is my online resume. On top of that it shows I can do web programming and am a pretty decent graphics designer.

####Setup####

Currently, I am user Bower for depenency management. I reminds me of Gradle for Java, so I like it.

For an IDE, I am using Brackets, since it has a lot of kickass extensions.

Dependencies: jquery, jquery-ui (not using jquery-ui atm, but may later)

Project directories:
    
    root directory: index, bower.json, .bowerrc
    css: CSS3 styles
      css\images: images for css sheets
    js: javascript files
    php: php files
    views: various views of menu
    bower_componenets: bower packages

####Versions####

There are two versions with slight view differences.
1. Main version (index.html) with wave at top
2. Alt version (index-alt.html) with wavey line on left


####Hosting####

Currently 2 domains I have created registered through freehostingnoads.net/ .
    
    ajagoda.me
    ajagoda.org

They currently seem to be not registered and are down.

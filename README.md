my-personal-website is a web project I am working on.

Webpage containing information related to me. This is a work in progress, as is my programming career.

Basically this is my online resume. On top of that it shows I can do web programming and am a pretty decent graphics designer.

For an IDE, I am using Brackets, since it has a lot of kickass extensions.

Project directories:
    
    root directory: main files
    css: CSS3 styles
    js: javascript files
    php: php files
    views: various views of menu
